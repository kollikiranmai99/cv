<h2>Work From home in Pandemic:</h2></td>
    <td>These tips will help you make sure that you’re successful, both at getting your work done and at
       maintaining your mental well-being.
    Please follow the below.</td> <br> <br>

<tr>
  <td><h4>Getting Dressed:</h4></td>
<td>It might seem like a simple tip, but it’s a crucial one. Before coming to work for The Muse,
   I spent about eight months working from home when my full-time office job became a remote position with little warning.
    It was tempting to stay in my pajamas all day,
   but any day I gave into temptation was much slower to start and less productive overall </td>

<tr>
  <td>  <h4>Designate a Workspace or Home Office:</h4>
</td>
<td>One of the big challenges when it comes to working remotely is keeping your work and home lives separate
If you never fully disconnect from work, your work productivity will suffer and your home life can take a hit as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><h4>Keep Clearly Defined Working Hours:</h4>
</td>
  <td>Just as you designate and separate your physical workspace,
    you should be clear about when you’re working and when you’re not</td>
