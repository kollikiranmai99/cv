  <h2>Work From home in Pandemic:</h2>
  <p>These tips will help you make sure that you’re successful, both at getting your work done and at maintaining your mental well-being.
  Please follow the below.</p>

  <p>It might seem like a simple tip, but it’s a crucial one. Before coming to work for The Muse, I spent about eight months working from home when my full-time office job became a remote position with little warning. It was tempting to stay in my pajamas all day, but any day I gave into temptation was much slower to start and less productive overall </p>
